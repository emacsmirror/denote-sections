# Denote Sidecar Sections

This package integrates [`denote`](https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote) with the [Universal Sidecar](https://git.sr.ht/~swflint/emacs-universal-sidecar).
As of now, it provides only one section, a backlinks section to mimic that of `org-roam`.

The backlinks section, `denote-sections-backlinks-section` may be used as any other, simply add it to `universal-sidecar-sections`, it has no present customization.
